# Using SSM framework
We are not using the Spark + Velocity + SQLite framework. Instead, we are using Spring + SpringMVC + Mybatis framework.

# Current progress
- We implemented the Account and Notes classes for the user story. 
- The database is a MySQL database created locally.
- The database has a connection problem, which prevents us to implement further development.
- The index.jsp is a dummy temp index page for testing the SSM framework, and it is working except for the database post part.
- The index_backup.jsp is our main page for the project purpose.
