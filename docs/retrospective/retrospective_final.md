# Final Retrospective

## Things we delivered (and things we didn't)

For the final app, we delivered all of our core features -- a task management web system with auto text correction for notes and auto scheduler for tasks. In addition, we also delivered one more beyond CRUD feature -- hand writting recognition for notes. 

For the software design, we mostly developed the app with our orignal design of UML, with improvements in model design in later iterations. 

## Difficulties We Had

We had difficulties in almost every part of the app development -- front end, server side, and database. For the example, we used to have an issue with list display logic for the front end, and table insertion problems for the PostGreSQL database on Heroku. But luckily, we were able to overcome each challenges. 

## Look Back on Iteration 1 

We had a relatively unsuccessful iteration 1, for the fact that the code we delivered in iteration 1 was not functioning (mainly due to the tech stack we chose but none of us was familiar with it). So if we could ever start iteration 1 again, here are the things we would focus much much more: 

* Communication! Communication! Communication! 
* Team structure. We need some one to make the calls, especially when only a few us have a clear picture of what we will build. Also, we would avoid dividing the team into frontend/backend teams too early. 
* The feasibility of choice of tech stack.
