# Software Requirement Specifications

## Problem Statement

- Task management and note taking apps on the market have limited flexibility and customizability.

- I want a software that allows me to select features and functionalities based on what type of list-format document I need. 

- After investigation over the current solutions available to the users, we found that: Google Keep does not provide a due date feature; Monday.com is web-based and is heavily aimed at team collaboration; Microsoft ToDo only supports document printing but does not allow exporting to text file; Outlook is highly coupled with the other Microsoft Office softwares; almost all of them require users to upload their lists to the cloud.

## Potential Clients

- Students

- Employees

- Manager

- Team collaborators

- Multitasker

## Proposed Solution

- A functionality-flexible list management software where users can select features upon creating a document.

## Functional Requirements

### Must have

- As a multitasker, I want different groups of features to be selectable to my different types of lists, so that I don’t need to go to multiple apps for different features.

- As a busy user, I want to have an optional auto-scheduling function that can match my tasks with my available time slots. 

- As a note-taker, I want to have an extension to record my random thoughts, so that I can look back and use some of the ideas.

- As a student or employee, I want to have a time management extension to manage my to-do lists, so that I can work efficiently.

### Nice to have

- As a manager, I want my to-do lists to be only stored locally, so that I don’t need to worry about the sensitive information of the company.

- As an employee, I want to upload my notes or to-do list on the cloud.

- As a team collaborator, I want to have my to-do list visible and shareable to my team, so that everyone knows how hard I work.

- As a student or employee, I may want to link my to-do list in the notes.

## Software Architecture

- Client-server architecture

- Server stores user documents (local and cloud), client allows user interaction and graphical elements.
